# Voron-Lightweight-Toolhead

Credit and thanks to the designers of the EVA and VZ Printhead on which this is based (and borrowed from), as well as the Dev team at Voron... and for all the work they have and continue to do !

This is my version of the above toolheads, designed for the Voron 2.4 and Trident. Compatible with 5015 fan and CPAP, and requires an umbillical or Can board.
Current version uses a Rapido HF , with 2510 Hotend fan , and a Euclid probe. I'll try to add some additional supprt as I go.


Warning however. this will result in a loss of X and Y travel , and requires a bit of modification to your config . Recommended for advanced users comfortable with 
adjusting all necessary parameters.

2510 fan uses M2.5x14 BHCS , Euclid probe uses M2x6 BHCS to attach the probe to the mount, and the normal M2 self tappers for the X endstop microswitch. All others use various lengths of M3 BHCS, along with the standard M3 Heatset inserts.

I also reccomend relocating your Z chain to below the rear extrusion . This is the design i used on mine https://www.printables.com/model/279739-voron-can-bus-z-chain-move
